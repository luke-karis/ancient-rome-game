  primarySourceEvent: "Sallust wrote how the conspirators sought to \u201Cmurder the
    consuls Lucius Cotta and Lucius Torquatus on the Capitoline on the first of January,
    to seize the fasces for themselves\u201D  (Sallust, War with Catiline, 18.5)."
  primarySourceAuthor: Sallust was a Roman politician and historian from the late
    Roman Republic. Sallust wrote this quote as part of his first work called War
    with Catiline.
  primarySourceContext: The fasces were a bundle of wooden rods approximately 5 feet
    and single headed axe held together by red thongs. They were a symbol of magisterial
    legitimacy and authority and by stealing the conspirators surely meant to symbolically
    assume the authority of the consulship.
  Advice: Before you support a venture like this, I would advise to think of the future
    ramifications
  RightOption: Decry the plans as foolish and not likely to work
