  primarySourceEvent: "Sallust writes that \u201Cknowledge of this plot leaked\u201D
    and that for this reason the conspirators \u201Chad postponed their murderous
    design until the fifth of February\u201D (Sallust, War with Catiline, 18.6)."
  primarySourceAuthor: 'Gaius Sallustius Crispus (Anglicized to Sallust) was a Roman
    politician and historian from the late Roman Republic. He wrote this quote as
    part of his first work, War with Catiline. '
  primarySourceContext: The consuls were the chief executives of the Roman state.
    This plan was quite a desperate one which would almost certainly not have worked.
  Advice: Plots against other Romans are serious and should not be taken lightly.
