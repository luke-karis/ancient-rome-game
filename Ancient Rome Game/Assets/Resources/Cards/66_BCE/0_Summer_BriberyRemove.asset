  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CIn the consulship of Lucius Tullus and Manius Lepidus,
    \ the consuls elect, Publius Autronius and Publius Sulla, were indicted under
    the law covering corruption electioneering and convicted\u201D (Sallust, War with
    Catiline 18.2)."
  primarySourceAuthor: 'Gaius Sallustius Crispus (Anglicized to Sallust) was a Roman
    politician and historian from the late Roman Republic. He wrote this quote as
    part of his first work, War with Catiline. '
  primarySourceContext: This quote depicts what is considered part of the first Catilinarian
    conspiracy. Despite its name it is unclear how much Catiline was actually involved
    in this plot especially in contrast to the second Catilinarian conspiracy where
    Catiline was clearly the instigator.
  Advice: Bribery is not looked upon favorably by many of the upper class
  RightOption: Reach out to the two disgraced politicians secretly and offer your
    sympathies
