  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CThere chanced to be staying at Rome two ambassadors of
    the Allobroges, a nation which at that time was in a particularly evil plight
    and felt  oppressed by the Roman sway. These men Lentulus and his partisans thought
    would be useful in stiffing up Gaul to revolt\u201D (Plutarch, Cicero XVIII.3)."
  primarySourceAuthor: Plutarch was a Greek biographer and essayist who lived during  the
    early Roman Empire. This quote comes from his biography of Marcus Tullius Cicero.
  primarySourceContext: Lentulus was an accomplice of Catiline operating in the city
    of Rome and the Allobroges were a Gallic tribe. The Roman province of Gaul extended
    only to southern France at this point.
  Advice: This is extremely bad news for Catalina and I would distance myself from
    him
  RightOption: Give this information to Cicero and let him make a decision
