  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CCicero went forth and summoned the senate...Catiline
    also came with the rest in order to make his defence; no senator, however, would
    sit with him but all moved away from the bench where he was\u201D (Plutarch, Cicero
    XVI.3)."
  primarySourceAuthor: Plutarch was a Greek biographer and essayist who lived during  the
    early Roman Empire. This quote comes from his biography of Marcus Tullius Cicero.
  primarySourceContext: "Cicero\u2019s speech against Catiline is one of his most
    famous orations in part because of how complete it is. Some suggest that Cicero
    used these speeches as a way to cement his legacy.  "
