  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CHe is selling all the public property in Italy item by
    item. No doubt he is busy about that, for he does not let a single item pass.
    He searches through the whole of Sicily in the censors\u2019 registers; he leaves
    no building, no lands unnoticed\u201D (Cicero, De Lege Agraria 1.2)."
  primarySourceAuthor: "Cicero was a Roman statesman, orator, lawyer, and philosopher
    who lived in the Roman republic. This quote comes from Cicero\u2019s speech opposing
    the land bill of Servilius Rullus."
  primarySourceContext: Some scholars believe that Rullus put forth this bill for
    the powerful politician Marcus Licinius Crassus who was a rival of Pompey. It
    is thought that this bill could be used to bargain with Pompey who was returning
    to Rome from a military conquest and would undoubtedly like to find land for his
    veterans.
  Advice: Supporting this type of bill will almost certainly increase your standing
    among the populares.
  RightOption: Oppose Cicero by supporting the bill in the senate
