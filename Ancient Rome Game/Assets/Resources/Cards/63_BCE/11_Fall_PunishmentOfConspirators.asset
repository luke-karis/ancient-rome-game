  primarySourceEvent: "\u201COn the following day the senate discussed the punishment
    of the conspirators, and Silanus, who was the first to be asked to give his opinion,
    said they ought to be taken to prison and there suffer extremest punishment\u201D
    (Plutarch, Cicero XX.3)."
  primarySourceAuthor: Plutarch was a Greek biographer and essayist who lived during  the
    early Roman Empire. This quote comes from his biography of Marcus Tullius Cicero.
  primarySourceContext: The Romans did not have state operated prisons so this notion
    of taking the conspirators to prison was more likely to involve putting these
    conspirators under house arrest.
  Advice: Now is a good time to further distance yourself from Catiline and build
    new alliances
