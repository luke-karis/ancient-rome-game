  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CThereupon Catiline promised abolition of debts, the proscription
    of the rich, offices, priesthoods,  plunder, and all the other spoils that war
    and the license of citors can offer\u201D (Sallust, War with Catiline XXI.1-2)."
  primarySourceAuthor: Sallust was a Roman politician and historian from the late
    Roman Republic. Sallust wrote this quote as part of his first work called War
    with Catiline.
  primarySourceContext: According to Sallust, Catiline made these promises to his
    close supporters when they asked what they would win if they waged civil war.
    It is very unlikely that Catiline used this type of language when speaking to
    others not directly involved in his plots.
  Advice: "This platform of Cataline\u2019s is sure to have many opponents in the
    Senate and seems like an act of desperation"
  RightOption: "Support Catiline\u2019s renewed bid for the consulship "
