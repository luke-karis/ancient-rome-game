  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CHe has robbed the Treasury, and plundered Asia and Pamphylia;
    he has behaved like a pirate in his city praetorship, and like a destroying pestilence
    in his province of Sicily\u201D (Cicero, In Verrem 1.2-3)."
  primarySourceAuthor: "Cicero was a Roman statesman, orator, lawyer, and philosopher
    who lived in the Roman republic. This quote comes from Cicero\u2019s prosecution
    of Gaius Verres, the former governor of Sicily. "
  primarySourceContext: "This case was very important to Cicero\u2019s political career
    as he was able to so fully and expertly condemn Verres that there was no way the
    man could counter the charges causing him to go into exile. "
  Advice: Many governors exploit the native populations of their provinces but this
    goes beyond the norm
  RightOption: Write a letter to Rome complaining of the governor's corruption
