  primarySourceEvent: "\u201C[Cicero] was appointed quaestor at a time when grain
    was scarce, and had the province of Sicily allotted to him, where he annoyed people
    at first by compelling them to send grain to Rome\u201D (Plutarch, Cicero 5.6)."
  primarySourceAuthor: Plutarch was a Greek biographer and essayist who lived during  the
    early Roman Empire. This quote comes from his biography of Marcus Tullius Cicero.
  primarySourceContext: Quaestors stationed abroad in Roman provinces would serve
    under a pro Consul or pro Praetor who would be the Roman in charge of the territory.
    These pro Consuls and pro Praetors were Roman politicians who had already held
    either the office of Consul or Praetor.
