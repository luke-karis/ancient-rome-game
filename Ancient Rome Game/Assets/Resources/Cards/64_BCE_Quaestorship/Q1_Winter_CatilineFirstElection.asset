  primarySourceEvent: "In the consulship of Lucius Tullus and Manius Lepidus (66 BCE)
    \u201CCatiline  was charged with extortion and prevented from standing for the
    consulship, because he had been unable to announce his candidacy within the prescribed
    number of days\u201D (Sallust, War with Catiline, 18.3)."
  primarySourceAuthor: Sallust was a Roman politician and historian from the late
    Roman Republic. Sallust wrote this quote as part of his first work called War
    with Catiline.
  primarySourceContext: 'Catiline was brought to trial in 65 BCE but was acquitted
    in part because he had the support of many leading politicians of the time. '
  Advice: Catiline has quite an unsavory reputation, I would be cautious supporting
    him
  RightOption: Say that you will gladly give him your support
