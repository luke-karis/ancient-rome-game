  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CFurther, a \u201Cnew man\u201D can be greatly helped
    by the good will of nobles, and especially of the ex-consuls; it is an advantage
    that those whose position and company you wish to attain should think you worthy
    of that position and company\u201D (Quintus Tullius Cicero, Handbook of Electioneering,
    4-5). "
  primarySourceAuthor: 'Quintus Tullius Cicero was the brother of Marcus Tullius Cicero
    and apparently wrote this quote as a part of advice on how Marcus Cicero should
    seek the consulship. However, some scholars debate whether it was written by Quintus
    at all due to some inconsistencies in it. '
  primarySourceContext: "Canvassing and campaigning was extremely important for those
    seeking high office especially for Cicero since he was a \u201Cnew man', meant
    that he did not have an ancestor who had held the consulship. "
  Advice: Cicero is well respected but his family ties are not nearly as prestigious
    as most who vie for the consulship
  RightOption: Respond that you will gladly give him your support and denounce Cataline
