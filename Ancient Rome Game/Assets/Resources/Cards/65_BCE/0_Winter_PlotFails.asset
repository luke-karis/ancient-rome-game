  cardText: The murderous plan fails when one of the conspirators is too hasty in
    giving the signal to start

  primarySourceEvent: "Sallust writes that Catiline was \u201Coverhasty in giving
    the signal to his accomplices in front of the senate house\u201D causing the plan
    to fail because \u201Cthe armed conspirators had not yet assembled in sufficient
    numbers\u201D (Sallust, War with Catiline, 18.8)."
  primarySourceAuthor: Sallust was a Roman politician and historian from the late
    Roman Republic. Sallust wrote this quote as part of his first work called War
    with Catiline.
  primarySourceContext: "Some scholars believe that this work was written in part
    to clear Sallust\u2019s patron, Caesar, from any wrongdoing. This could partly
    explain why Catiline is displayed as being a member of this plot and shown as
    an extremely unsavory character."
  Advice: Perhaps now a good time would be a good time to distance yourself from these
    conspirators
  RightOption: Offer to defend Paetus and Sulla in court if this matter is ever revisited
