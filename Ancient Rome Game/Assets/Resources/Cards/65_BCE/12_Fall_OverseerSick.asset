  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CSome slave owners exposed their sick slaves in a languishing
    condition on the island of Aesculapius, due to the tediousness of their cure\u201D
    (Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars: Claudius 25.2)."
  primarySourceAuthor: 'Suetonius was a Roman historian who wrote during the early
    imperial era of Rome. His most important work involves writing about the early
    leaders of the Roman empire. In Lives of the Caesars: Claudius, he writes about
    the life of the emperor Claudius.'
  primarySourceContext: Disease was a leading cause for death in Rome and could spread
    quickly in areas where humans were living in close proximity like a City or slaves
    on a plantation.
  Advice: I would suggest picking an intelligent overseer that you trust to be able
    to handle the manually difficult life on a farm
