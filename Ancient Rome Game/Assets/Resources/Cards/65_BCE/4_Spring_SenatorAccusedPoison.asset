  primarySourceEvent: "Cicero describes the charges as \u201Cone about some gold,
    one about some poison, in which one and the same character is concerned. It is
    alleged that the gold was taken from Clodia, the poison procured to be given to
    Clodia\u201D (Cicero, Pro Caelio 13)."
  primarySourceAuthor: "Cicero was a Roman statesman, orator, lawyer, and philosopher
    who lived in the Roman republic. This quote comes from Cicero\u2019s defence of
    Marcus Caelius Rufus."
  primarySourceContext: The Roman judicial system did not have state funded prosecutors
    so private citizens had to bring cases against each other to punish wrongdoing.
    This process was sometimes used immorally to damage an opponent's reputation.
  Advice: Winning legal cases is an excellent way to build your reputation
