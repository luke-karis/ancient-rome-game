    who die intestate fall first to their sui heredes. By sui heredes are meant descendants
    who are in the dying man\u2019s potestas, for example, a son or daughter, grandson
    or granddaughter through a son, (or) a great-grandson or great-granddaughter through

  primarySourceAuthor: 'Gaius was a Roman jurist who lived during the Roman empire.
    This quote comes from the Institutes, a Roman introductory textbook of legal institutions. '
  primarySourceContext: 'Inheritance was very important to the Romans and the Romans
    often practiced adoption to make sure that they would have someone to inherit
    their wealth and property when they died. However, given child and infant mortality
    the Romans would generally only adopt adults. '
  Advice: I would advise you to trust only in yourself if you want to be successful.
  RightOption: Go visit the plantation to make sure it is being run well.
