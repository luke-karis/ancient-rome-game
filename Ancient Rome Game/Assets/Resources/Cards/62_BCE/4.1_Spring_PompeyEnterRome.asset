  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CPompey sent a request to the senate that they should
    put off the consular elections, asking them to grant him this favour in order
    that he might personally assist PIso in his candidacy\u201D (Plutarch, Pompey
    44.1)."
  primarySourceAuthor: Plutarch was a Greek biographer and essayist who lived during  the
    early Roman Empire. This quote comes from his biography of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus
    also known as Pompey or Pompey the Great.
  primarySourceContext: This request went against roman law and tradition that a commander
    would stay outside the city of Rome until they were awarded a triumph
  Advice: I think it unwise to go against tradition in this case
  RightOption: Side with Cato and argue Pompey should not be allowed in Rome
