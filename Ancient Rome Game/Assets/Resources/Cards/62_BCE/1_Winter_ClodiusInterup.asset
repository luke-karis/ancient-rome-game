  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CPompeia was celebrating this festival, and Clodius, who
    was still beardless and on this account thought to pass unnoticed, assumed the
    dress and implements of a lute-girl and went into the house\u201D (Plutarch, Caesar
    10.1)."
  primarySourceAuthor: Plutarch was a Greek biographer and essayist who lived during  the
    early Roman Empire. This quote comes from his biography of Gaius Julius Caesar.
  primarySourceContext: The festival that was being celebrated by these women was
    for the Roman goddess called Bona Dea and thus this scandal is called the Bona
    Dea Scandal.
  Advice: The patricians generally like to protect their own but Clodius is not very
    popular with members of his class
  RightOption: Write to Clodius offering your support
