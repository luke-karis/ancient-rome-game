  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CI am defending as best I can the alliance I myself cemented.
    But as this is all so unreliable, I am building another road, a safe one I hope,
    to protect my position. I can\u2019t very well explain what I mean in a letter,
    but a small hint will show: I am on the friendliest terms with Pompey\u201D (Cicero,
    Att. 1.17.10)."
  primarySourceAuthor: "Cicero was a Roman statesman, orator, lawyer, and philosopher
    who lived in the Roman republic. This quote comes from one of Cicero\u2019s letters
    to his friend Atticus."
  primarySourceContext: 'Cicero is clearly alluding to the possibility of an alliance
    with Pompey in this quote. Political alliances could be very powerful in the late
    republic especially if influential politicians joined forces. '
  Advice: "Cicero\u2019s intentions are good but I wonder if he is being too high
    minded"
  RightOption: "Agree with him and say you\u2019ll do your best"
