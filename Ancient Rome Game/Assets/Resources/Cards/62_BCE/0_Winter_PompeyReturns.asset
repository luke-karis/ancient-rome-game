  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CPompey, accordingly, as soon as he set foot in Italy,
    held an assembly of his soldiers, and after had said what fitted the occasion,
    and had expressed his gratitude and affection for them, he bade them disperse
    to their several cities and seek their homes\u201D  (Plutarch, Pompey XLIII.2)."

    early Roman Empire. This quote comes from his biography of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus
    also known as Pompey or Pompey the Great.
  primarySourceContext: Some elite Romans worried that Pompey would not disband his
    army when he returned and instead would march on Rome as Sulla had and establish
    a dictatorship.
  Advice: Pompey would be a powerful ally but has enemies among the optimates.
