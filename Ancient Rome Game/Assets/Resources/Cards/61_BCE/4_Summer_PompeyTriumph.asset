  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CHis triumph had such a magnitude that although it was
    distributed over two days, still the time would not suffice, but much of what
    had been prepared could not find a place in the spectacle\u201D (Plutarch, Pompey
    45.1). "
  primarySourceAuthor: Plutarch was a Greek biographer and essayist who lived during  the
    early Roman Empire. This quote comes from his biography of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus
    also known as Pompey or Pompey the Great.
  primarySourceContext: 'A triumph was a military procession led by a successful Roman
    general when they returned to Rome. It  was the one of the highest ambitions of
    Roman politicians and the decision whether or not a general received one rested
    in the Senate. '
  Advice: It might be best not to antagonize Pompey over something that he has rightfully
    earned
  RightOption: Decry the triumph as blatant populism
