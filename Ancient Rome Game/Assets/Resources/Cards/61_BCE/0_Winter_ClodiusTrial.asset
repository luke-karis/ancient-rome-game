  primarySourceEvent: "\u201CClodius was acquitted of the charge, the majority of
    the jurors giving their verdicts in illegible writing, in order that they might
    neither risk their lives with the populace by condemning him, nor get a bad name
    among the nobility by acquitting him\u201D (Plutarch, Caesar 10.7)."
  primarySourceAuthor: 'Author: Plutarch was a Greek biographer and essayist who lived
    during  the early Roman Empire. This quote comes from his biography of Gaius Julius
    Caesar.'
  primarySourceContext: Some ancient sources also suggest that the jurors were bribed
    and that is why Clodius was acquitted.
  Advice: This is a serious charge and should not be taken lightly
  RightOption: 'Offer to secretly bribe the jurors '
